# Contributing

This manifesto is a living document. We welcome thoughtful contributions.

## How to Contribute

- **Translations** — We'd love to see the manifesto in other languages. Open a PR with a new file named `MANIFESTO.<lang>.md` (e.g. `MANIFESTO.pl.md`).
- **Suggestions** — Open an Issue to propose a change, share a perspective, or start a discussion.
- **Corrections** — Typos, grammar, clarity improvements — PRs are welcome.

## Guidelines

- Keep the spirit of the manifesto intact: integrative, non-dogmatic, practice-oriented.
- Be respectful. This is a space for honest, courageous conversation.
- If proposing a change to a core belief, explain your reasoning in the Issue or PR description.

## Code of Conduct

Engage with honesty and respect. The laboratory belongs to everyone who enters it with courage.
